    This section outlines the key hypotheses and assumptions guiding the data analysis

    **Example Hypotheses:**
    1. A higher number of people from less developed or lower-income countries are affected by natural disasters compared to developed nations. 
    2. Since the 2000s, there has been an increase in the frequency of severe weather-related events such as floods, cyclones, and heatwaves. 
    3. Earthquakes, although less frequent than floods, have a more severe impact on humans compared to floods.

    If actual GDACS data follows this pattern, it would support the hypothesis that higher-severity
    alerts are linked with longer-lasting disaster events.
